# Hi there! 

## ‚úã My name is Arnau

## üöÄ Project I'm working on:

- **[EnoughTime](https://github.com/feliu89/enoughtime)**: A web and mobile application to register the time spent on doins your averyday tasks.

## ‚ù§ More about me:

It motivates me to be able to design products with a good user experience, a good design and learning new technologies. There is no greater satisfaction than bringing an idea to reality and being able to see that it is useful for other people.

I love music, traveling, reading, dogs and the fresh mountain air.
