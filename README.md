## 👋 Hi there! I'm Arnau

I am a Software Engineer experienced in Javascript. These are some the tech stack I work with: Node.js, Express, Koa, GraphQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, React and React Native.

## 🚀 Projects I'm working on:

- **[Concept](https://github.com/feliu89/concept)**: A mobile application to manage any idea which can be shared to everyone.
- **[EnoughTime](https://github.com/feliu89/enoughtime)**: A web application to register the time spent on your everyday tasks.

## ❤ More about me:

I enjoy designing new products with a good user experience and learning new technologies. There is no greater satisfaction than bringing an idea to reality and knowing that is useful for other people.

I love listening to music, traveling, reading, dogs and the fresh mountain air.
